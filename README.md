# Pack-Track

Welcome to Pack-Track, the best way to track your vacation expenses. Add new locations to your journey on our Stops page with a budget total, arrival date, and departure date. Once stops have been added, add your expenses to each stop to make sure you're staying on track. Safe travels!

Inspired by my recent trip in Europe, this app was built with React and Firebase. This was my first time using Firebase so there were a number of paint points trying to get things set up, and it took awhile to sort out how to structure the data for the application. This app went through a number of different iterations as it progressed in complexity. This is one of the most component-ized applications I've built to date, and I'm happy with the result. As a next step, I would like to explore D3.js and create a "Reporting Dashboard" where the user can compare their expenses between categories and locations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
